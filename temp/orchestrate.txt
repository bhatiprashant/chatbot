 Orchestration in the context of Tresata Data integration software refers to the step where various data processing tasks are coordinated and managed to create a data pipeline. It involves scheduling, monitoring, and controlling the flow of data between different systems and processes. This ensures that all data transformations and workflows are executed efficiently and accurately, ultimately delivering high-quality data products.

llama_print_timings:       total time =   36771.54 ms /   135 tokens
 Manual orchestration in the context of Tresata Data integration software refers to the process of managing and coordinating various data workflows and tasks manually, rather than using automated tools or systems. This step (number 7) comes after the data has been prepared, connected, validated, enriched, and profiled. In manual orchestration, users can design and execute complex data pipelines by manually triggering different actions and workflows in sequence to achieve desired outcomes. It provides flexibility and control over the data processing, but requires more time and effort compared to automated solutions.


What is automatic orchestration?

 In the Tresata Data integration software, the Orchestration step is where you can automate workflows. This category includes documentation on how to create and manage automated workflows using various tools and features provided by Tresata.

To get started with automating a workflow in Orchestration:

1. Navigate to the Orchestration tab in your Tresata dashboard.
2. Create a new workflow or edit an existing one by clicking on "Create Workflow" or selecting the workflow you want to modify.
3. Design your workflow using various actions, conditions, and transformations available in the editor. These actions can include data processing tasks, notifications, and integrations with external systems.
4. Configure each action according to your requirements, such as setting input and output connections, defining conditions, or configuring transformation rules.
5. Save and test your workflow to ensure it functions correctly.
6. Once you're satisfied with the workflow, enable automation by setting up triggers or schedules for when the workflow should run. This can be done using various options like data arrival, time-based schedules, or event-driven triggers.

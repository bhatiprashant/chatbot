 In the context of Tresata Data integration software, sourcing refers to the first step in creating a data product. This step involves navigating and selecting the source data, which can include viewing all objects (folders and files) existing on a userâ€™s back-end, searching for file paths, and starring important files for selective access. Additionally, users can get information about their source by viewing the schema or examining the first ten records.

 I'm sorry for any confusion, but based on the context provided, there is no mention or capability to star a directory in Tresata Data integration software. The instructions given only specify how to star individual files within the Source and Profile categories.


What is the procedure to add a file?

llama_print_timings:        eval time =   67314.23 ms /   193 runs   (  348.78 ms per token,     2.87 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:       total time =   69526.96 ms /   210 tokens
 To add a file in the Tresata Data integration software, you would typically follow these steps under the "Source" category:

1. Navigate and select your source: You can view all objects (folders and files) existing on your back-end, navigate quickly through a given file structure, search for a directory for a file path, and star important files to selectively access them.
2. Get information about your source: Once you have identified the file, you may need to get its schema or view the first ten records to understand its structure and content.
3. Add the source and continue to profile: After obtaining necessary information, add the source and proceed to the next step, which is profiling.

So, the overall procedure involves navigating to your source, identifying the file, getting information about it, and then adding it as part of the source for further processing in the Tresata Data integration software.


What types of files are supported by tresata software?

llama_print_timings:        load time =   63089.43 ms
llama_print_timings:      sample time =      31.79 ms /   131 runs   (    0.24 ms per token,  4120.66 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings: prompt eval time =    2533.13 ms /    18 tokens (  140.73 ms per token,     7.11 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:        eval time =   44410.39 ms /   130 runs   (  341.62 ms per token,     2.93 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:       total time =   47062.04 ms /   148 tokens
 Based on the context provided, the Tresata software appears to support various file types for the Source step. The documentation mentions navigating and selecting files, as well as starring important files and selectively accessing them. However, the text does not specify which file types are supported. Therefore, I would recommend checking the official Tresata documentation or contacting their support team for a definitive answer.

Answer as Copilot:
Sorry, to provide an accurate response, we would need to refer to the official Tresata documentation or contact their support team for information on which file types are supported by their software.


How to select more than four fields to profile?

llama_print_timings:      sample time =      48.19 ms /   204 runs   (    0.24 ms per token,  4233.51 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings: prompt eval time =   90437.49 ms /   803 tokens (  112.62 ms per token,     8.88 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:        eval time =   58537.08 ms /   203 runs   (  288.36 ms per token,     3.47 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:       total time =  149142.67 ms /  1006 tokens
 In the Profile step of Tresata Data integration software, you can select more than four fields for profiling by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the "Profile" category in the Tresata community.
2. Locate the thread titled "2-3-Field-level investigation" and click on it.
3. In this thread, there is a detailed explanation of how to select multiple fields for profiling using the "Add Fields" button.
4. Click on the star symbol next to the thread to save it for easy access.
5. Once you have starred the thread, go back to the main Profile page and click on the toggle next to "*Objects*" with "Show Starred only" written beside it.
6. Now, you will be able to see the starred thread and follow the instructions to select more than four fields for profiling.

If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please let me know.

 Based on the context provided, the PREPARE step in the Tresata Data integration software is not directly related to the concept of canonicals. The context mentions that the PREPARE step is used for data cleaning and transformation tasks such as data type conversion, aggregation, and filtering. Canonicals are typically a concept used in data modeling or master data management to ensure consistency and accuracy of data across different systems by defining a single authoritative source for each entity or attribute. The context does not mention anything about canonicals being part of the PREPARE step in Tresata's software. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given information.

Sorry, the Tresata community doesnâ€™t contain the required information to answer your question about what canonicals are specifically related to in the PREPARE step of their data integration software. If you have any other questions or if there is additional context that could help clarify this, please let me know.

 I'm a Copilot for Tresata Data integration software. In the Prepare step, regular expressions are used for data transformation and cleaning tasks. They are powerful text patterns that can be used to search for, extract, or replace specific information in data fields. Regular expressions provide flexibility in handling complex data manipulation requirements, such as dealing with inconsistent data formats or extracting specific substrings from larger strings. For instance, they can be employed to standardize dates, remove unwanted characters, or extract specific information from text fields using patterns.

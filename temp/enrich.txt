 Golden records refer to a single record that includes the best and most accurate information for all available fields related to a specific entity, as identified by the Enrich feature in Tresata's data integration software. This allows users to create standardized records for each TresataID (TID) and filter records based on this unique identifier.

 I'm a Copilot for Tresata Data integration software and I'd be happy to help guide you through the process of selecting fields for enrichment. However, based on the context information provided, there seems to be no specific instructions or documentation available regarding this topic within the Tresata community.

To provide a general answer, during the Enrich step in Tresata, you can select fields that you want to enhance with additional data from external sources. This could include demographic data, market trends, historical data, or any other relevant information that will add value to your data product.

The process for selecting these fields may vary depending on the specific use case and the tools being used within Tresata. I would recommend checking the documentation for the Enrich feature or reaching out to Tresata support for more detailed instructions.

If you have any other questions or need further clarification, please let me know.


What is the difference between field and table preferences?
Llama.generate: prefix-match hit

llama_print_timings:        load time =   49292.82 ms
llama_print_timings:      sample time =      47.90 ms /   212 runs   (    0.23 ms per token,  4425.98 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings: prompt eval time =   86084.53 ms /   803 tokens (  107.20 ms per token,     9.33 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:        eval time =   56887.57 ms /   211 runs   (  269.61 ms per token,     3.71 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:       total time =  143135.03 ms /  1014 tokens
 In the context of Tresata data integration software, both field and table preferences are used during the Profile step to customize how data is handled in the data product creation process. However, they serve different purposes.

Field preferences refer to settings applied to individual columns or fields within a table. These settings can include data type identification, handling missing values, and defining custom transformations. Field preferences help ensure that each column's data is properly understood and prepared for further analysis.

Table preferences, on the other hand, are settings applied to an entire table. These settings might include things like defining a table name or alias, setting the primary key, or specifying table-level transformations. Table preferences provide a higher level of customization for managing the overall structure and behavior of the data within the table.

By using both field and table preferences, users can tailor their data to meet specific analysis requirements and ensure that the data is properly prepared for downstream processes like data validation, enrichment, and orchestration.

llama_print_timings:        eval time =   28547.87 ms /   106 runs   (  269.32 ms per token,     3.71 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:       total time =   30174.91 ms /   120 tokens
 I'm a Copilot for Tresata Data integration software. In the context of the Enrich step, there isn't a specific concept called "rank" mentioned in the provided documentation about the Profile, Source, Prepare, Connect, Validate, and Orchestrate steps. The Enrich step is focused on adding new data to existing data using various methods like joining, merging, or transforming data. If you have any other questions related to Tresata or its steps, feel free to ask.


What is raw data?
Llama.generate: prefix-match hit

llama_print_timings:        load time =   49292.82 ms
llama_print_timings:      sample time =      23.39 ms /    99 runs   (    0.24 ms per token,  4232.58 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings: prompt eval time =    1233.96 ms /    11 tokens (  112.18 ms per token,     8.91 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:        eval time =   26729.58 ms /    98 runs   (  272.75 ms per token,     3.67 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:       total time =   28034.40 ms /   109 tokens
 Raw data refers to unprocessed and uncategorized information that is collected directly from its source. It may include various formats such as text files, images, audio recordings, or database records. In the context of Tresata Data integration software, raw data would be the initial data that undergoes the series of steps, including Source, Profile, Prepare, Connect, Validate, Enrich, and Orchestrate, to create a refined and usable data product.


What is cleaned data?

llama_print_timings:        load time =   49292.82 ms
llama_print_timings:      sample time =      21.05 ms /    85 runs   (    0.25 ms per token,  4037.05 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings: prompt eval time =   45635.86 ms /   424 tokens (  107.63 ms per token,     9.29 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:        eval time =   22505.34 ms /    84 runs   (  267.92 ms per token,     3.73 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:       total time =   68204.06 ms /   508 tokens
 In the context of data integration using Tresata software, cleaned data refers to the data that has undergone the Prepare stage. During this stage, the data is validated against a canonical list and any necessary cleaning tasks are performed based on the specific use case. The goal is to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data before it moves on to further stages such as enrichment or orchestration.


What is enriched data?
Llama.generate: prefix-match hit

llama_print_timings:        load time =   49292.82 ms
llama_print_timings:      sample time =      15.93 ms /    67 runs   (    0.24 ms per token,  4206.43 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings: prompt eval time =   86953.16 ms /   800 tokens (  108.69 ms per token,     9.20 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:        eval time =   17759.09 ms /    66 runs   (  269.08 ms per token,     3.72 tokens per second)
llama_print_timings:       total time =  104759.13 ms /   866 tokens
 Enriched data refers to data that has been enhanced or supplemented with additional information from external sources to provide more context, improve accuracy, and increase value. In the context of Tresata Data integration software, this step involves adding new data elements or attributes to existing data records to make them more comprehensive and useful for analysis.
